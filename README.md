# PuffinPower

## What Is This Thing?
PuffinPower is a database and communication app. It offers researchers tools to easily store, sort, and retrieve information on their subjects, and facilitates easy crowd-sourcing of further data by letting members of the public submit their own observations and images.

## Why is it Special?
Science always struggles with two things - funding, and public interest (which leads back to funding). This application attacks both issues at once; a small team suffers less pressure when people are out there gathering data for free, and when Joe Random spends time with the study subjects and feels engaged with the project, public interest and support rises.

## Features:
  1. User login for researchers
  2. Searchable photo & data of all puffins
  3. Easy-view profile of each puffin's data & photos
  4. Controllable access levels
  5. Photo submission from phone or camera

## How Do I Use It?
Taking and submitting pictures or text operates at the lowest access level, and can be done merely by logging on to the page. To explore the higher-level features of this demo, like database management, try using the login "rpetit" with the password "test2", which provides admin access.

## Who Made It?
Kaitlyn Steagall, Mars Getsoian, Renee Petit.

## Any Known Bugs?
- Authentication was stripped for demo purposes and needs to be added back in
